/**
 * A MongoDB command read against the inventory the run captured, before anything is sent.
 *
 * Two mistakes a MongoDB read makes are answered by the server with an empty result rather than an error, so a run
 * that makes either reports zero with evidence and is scored as having answered:
 *
 * - **A collection that does not exist.** The inventory names each collection with its database in front
 *   (`shop.orders`), and a command written that way reads a collection called `shop.orders` inside `shop`, which
 *   does not exist. Measured 2026-10-17: three of ten plan-mode drafts named a collection so, and the editor answered
 *   each with no rows; `queryReadOnly` answered `count: 0` for `shop.customers` and for `Customers`.
 * - **A string compared with a date or an ObjectId.** A read result shows both types as plain strings, and a string
 *   never equals either, so `{"created_at": {"$gte": "2026-03-01T00:00:00Z"}}` matched nothing where
 *   `{"$date": "2026-03-01T00:00:00Z"}` matched 578 orders; runs reported "0 orders" and "the event does not exist".
 *
 * Both are decided from the inventory only, and only where the inventory can decide them: a collection is called
 * missing only when the inventory claims to be complete (`truncated` and `unreadContainers` absent), and a field is
 * held to a type only when every sampled document agreed on it (`date` or `objectId`, never `mixed(...)`), and only in
 * the filters that address the collection's own documents: a find, findOne, count or distinct filter, and the `$match`
 * stages a pipeline opens with, before any stage reshapes the documents.
