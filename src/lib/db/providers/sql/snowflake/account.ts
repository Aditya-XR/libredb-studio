/**
 * The Snowflake API origin: `https://<host>:443`, built by the provider itself from the Account field's reading, so a

 *
 * Every check is `checkSnowflakeAccount`'s in `account-host.ts`, the one the dialog's hint and field check read too
 * (SF-025): an account URL with a port other than 443, a path, a query, a fragment or userinfo, an IPv4 literal as the
 * identifier, and a label or host a DNS name cannot hold. Every refusal is the Account format sentence, raised before
 * any socket, and never repeats the text, since a pasted URL can carry a token. `httpOrigin` then holds the host to
 * the shared host rules, which the reading already met.
