/**
 * The language-neutral contracts the tool layer and the language packs both state (#1821).
 *
 * Each of these is said identically wherever it is said: the selector and evidence schemas a definition offers, the
 * evidence and answer contracts its description quotes, the refusal sentences, and the few helpers that render a
 * citation or read a run's own ledger. `tools.ts` imports them, and so does every language pack, so a pack never has
 * to reach into `tools.ts` for a sentence or a schema.
 *
 * The refusal tables are the core's rows merged with the language packs' rows (`languages/refusals.ts`): the codes
 * stay in the core's unions, because the ledger persists them, and only a sentence one language alone says lives in
 * that language's pack. `mergeDisjoint` makes a code said by both sides a load-time error.
 *
 * Below `tools.ts`: every import from it is `import type`, so loading this module never evaluates the tool layer.
