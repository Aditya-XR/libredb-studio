  // was the dialect table — `CATALOG_PLANS` served two engines and this workflow
  // deliberately runs on the others — and it is now a reading that can fail on any
  // engine, since a dialect with no catalog plan asks its provider instead and
  // usually gets an inventory. The hedge is unchanged, because an ungrounded
  // operations run is still an ordinary thing. The per-run truth is in the opening
  // note, which is built from what this drive actually established.

  // a rule live runs fail (#350, #356), so the bar and its honest exception are both

  "Your report must cite at least one reading you took: this run answers with what the engine said about itself, not with what you expect of a database like this one.",
