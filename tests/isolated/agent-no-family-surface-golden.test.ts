 * The agent's surface on an engine with no statement family, held byte for byte to what it was before the run
 * resolver.
 *
 * `tests/fixtures/agent/no-family-surface/golden-no-family-agent-surface.json` was generated on the base commit by
 * the module this test runs; its docblock says how to regenerate it. Isolated because it builds real providers
 * through `createDatabaseProvider`, which the api layer's tests mock.
