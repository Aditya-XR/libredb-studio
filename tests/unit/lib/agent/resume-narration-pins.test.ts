 * recommendation it already made; the plan-bar notice; and the instrument count that refuses a narrowed run's fourth
 * workload profile.
 *
 * A resumed mongo run is told its profile under the SQL operation id. That is B127, pinned here as the current
 * behaviour so that no step of the language-pack work moves it by accident; the B127 fix changes this pin on purpose.
