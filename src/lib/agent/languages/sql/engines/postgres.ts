/**
 * The column inventory, one row per TABLE with its columns aggregated (B52).
 *
 * The projection used to be one row per COLUMN. Against `maxResultRows: 200` that
 * refused an unnarrowed capture on any PostgreSQL image whose own catalogs are wide
 * before the user creates anything. Two measurements exist and they disagree by
 * design, so each is stated with what it was taken UNDER: as a least-privilege agent
 * role on 2026-08-20, TimescaleDB answered 478 flat rows, Cloudberry 289 and AlloyDB
 * Omni 536; re-measured on 2026-09-01 with the aggregation in place and two seeded
 * user tables, the same reads answer 46, 67 and 70 OBJECT rows. The totals are
 * per-role and per-image and mean nothing without both.
 *
 * `json_agg … ORDER BY ordinal_position` keeps the column order, which is the one
 * property the flat projection used to guarantee. The object keys are the ones
 * `buildPostgresTables` reads (`name`, `type`, `nullable`), so the fold parses one
 * array per table instead of one row per column.
 *
 * MEASURED ON, and only on, the three servers B52 named plus stock PostgreSQL: the
 * aggregate runs on Cloudberry's MPP planner, which is the one that refuses other
 * reads with `multiple segworker groups is not supported`. It FAILS on RisingWave
 * 3.0.4, measured 2026-09-24: `json_build_object()` does not exist there, and with the
 * jsonb forms the read fails next on the relation exclusion's two-column
 * `ROW(...) NOT IN (SELECT ...)`, "Subquery must return only one column". NOT measured
 * on Materialize, which has no `json_agg()` either. Neither engine's registry caveats
 * promise agent grounding, so nothing regressed that was promised; a run that ever
 * claims grounding on either has to make this read answer first.
 *
 * The row budget now counts TABLES rather than columns, which is what a wide
 * catalog needs; two bounds still stand and are worth naming. A schema with more
 * than `maxResultRows` tables is still refused — B52 removes the per-column
 * overflow, not the per-table one — and a single table whose aggregated JSON
 * exceeds `maxResultBytes` is refused by the byte budget, the same backstop every
 * read meets, measured over the serialized rows. The model-facing pack then
 * bounds the prompt independently (`MAX_COLUMNS_PER_TABLE`,
 * `AGENT_CONTEXT_PACK_MAX_CHARS`), so a wide table does not spend the context
 * window on itself.
 *
 * This change closes B76: the aggregation that fixed the wide-catalog refusal
 * then admitted the image's own objects. The WHERE clause below now excludes
 * them three ways — the full engine-builtin schema list plus every schema an
 * extension created (both copied from the provider's object browser), AND every
 * RELATION an extension created (`pg_depend` with `classid = 'pg_class'::regclass`,
 * new on the agent path). The relation test is the load-bearing half on AlloyDB
 * Omni, whose 67 extension views mostly sit in `public` itself: no schema
 * filter can reach them, an ownership test can, and a user's own views are
 * never extension-owned so they survive.
 *
 * Every PostgreSQL catalog read carries the relation test, not only this one:
 * `inspect_schema` serves `indexes`, `statistics` and `relations` straight to
 * the model without passing them through `buildPostgresTables`, so a read that
 * filtered by schema alone would show a PostGIS-owned `spatial_ref_sys` in the
 * index and statistics inventories while hiding it from the column inventory.
 * The exclusion is applied where each statement identifies its own table, and
 * the four reads agree on the object set.
 *
 * Measured live on 2026-09-07 against the three `compat` images with two user
 * tables seeded: the column read answers 46 → 2 object rows on TimescaleDB,
 * 67 → 2 on Cloudberry and 70 → 2 on AlloyDB Omni. The sharp case is proven on
 * AlloyDB, not assumed: the schema half alone leaves 51 objects (the 2 user
 * tables plus the 49 extension views installed into `public`), `pg_depend`
 * reports 68 extension-owned relations there, and the relation ownership test
 * is what removes them. The committed tests pin the SQL SHAPE (the composed
 * text carries each filter); the row counts above are the live BEHAVIOUR, and
 * the two are asserted at different layers for that reason.
 *
 * `relkind` RIDES ALONG, and it is what lets a run be told what each entry IS
 * (#789). `information_schema.columns` answers a view's columns beside a table's
 * with nothing to tell them apart, which is the reading a model was handed a view
 * under the word table from. The engine's own word for the relation is one join
 * away - `pg_class` keyed by namespace and name - so it is read here rather than
 * bought with a fourth statement out of the run's budget, and
 * `context-snapshot.ts` maps it onto the kind id the PROVIDER declares. The raw
 * catalog character goes out rather than a word this file invented: the mapping
 * belongs where the declaration can be consulted.
 *
 * LEFT JOIN, deliberately, on both arms. The driver serves PostgreSQL-wire engines
 * nobody here has run, and one whose `pg_class` does not carry a row for a relation
 * `information_schema.columns` does answer for would lose that relation from the
 * whole inventory under an inner join. A missing `relkind` is an unknown kind,
 * which this path already knows how to say; a missing TABLE is the absence #414
 * measured. Both sides are cast to `text` because `sql_identifier` is a domain over
 * `name` on PostgreSQL 12 and later and over `character varying` before it, and the
 * cast is the one comparison that holds either way.
 *
 * Measured on postgres:18 against a fixture holding one relation of each kind: the
 * relkinds `information_schema.columns` actually returns are `r`, `p`, `v` and `f`.
 * A materialized view (`m`) and a sequence (`S`) are NOT in that catalog at all, so
 * this reading cannot see either, and a foreign table (`f`) is one it does see that
 * `postgres.ts` declares no kind for.

 * calling role OWNS or holds a privilege on other than `SELECT`. The least-privilege
 * role `docs/AGENT_DEMO.md` tells operators to create holds `SELECT` and nothing
 * else, so those views answered NOTHING for it — measured on the seeded dvdrental as
 * `libredb_agent`: 0 rows where `pg_constraint WHERE contype = 'f'` holds 18, and a
 * run then reported that the database declares no foreign keys. `pg_constraint` needs
 * only `USAGE` on the schema, and answers all 18. What the rewrite cannot reach is that
 * ANY role can be narrower than its database, so the relations block declines to report
 * an absence from an empty read at all — see `er-diagram.ts`.
 *
 * The same rewrite is what pairs a composite key. Neither view exposes an ordinal,
 * so `FOREIGN KEY (x, y) REFERENCES parents (a, b)` came back as the cross-product
 * of the two column lists; `unnest(conkey, confkey) WITH ORDINALITY` unnests the two
 * arrays TOGETHER, so position 1 of one side meets position 1 of the other and
 * nothing else. And it closes the collision underneath: a constraint NAME is unique
 * per table, so two tables in one schema may both carry `fk_shared` and the
 * referenced side could not be narrowed by table at all — `constraint_column_usage`
 * exposes no referencing table. A `pg_constraint` row carries `conrelid` and
 * `confrelid` on itself and is never matched by name.
 *
 * Both defects compounded rather than sitting side by side, which is why they were
 * fixed together: on a fixture holding a composite key and a second constraint of
 * the same name, the old joins returned NINE rows — three right — and gave one table
 * edges to a table its own constraint never mentions. This read returns the three.
 *
 * The output column names are the ones `buildPostgresTables` already reads, so the
 * fold consuming these rows is unchanged. The projection stays flat — one row per
 * referencing COLUMN — because the row cap refuses rather than truncates, and a flat
 * overflow is diagnosable where a nested aggregate's is not.

 * way to get the same numbers) is refused by the design rather than merely
 * unimplemented.
 *
 * FOUR things a consumer of these rows must not read as more than they are, all of
 * them consequences of the source rather than of this projection:
 *
 *  - **`reltuples` is an estimate, and `-1` means "never counted".** PostgreSQL 14+
 *    initialises it to -1 for a relation that has been neither `VACUUM`ed nor
 *    `ANALYZE`d; older servers left it at 0, which is indistinguishable from an
 *    empty table. A reader that prints -1 as a row count states a falsehood.
 *  - **`n_distinct` is NEGATIVE when it is a ratio.** PostgreSQL stores `-k` to mean
 *    "k * reltuples distinct values" (so -1 is a unique column) when the estimated
 *    count scales with the table. The conversion is deliberately NOT done here: it
 *    needs `reltuples`, which is itself an estimate that may be -1, and a converted
 *    number emitted under the name `n_distinct` would be a derived value wearing the
 *    raw one's name. Both columns go out raw and the reader converts and LABELS the
 *    result as derived (work item 2).
 *  - **A never-analysed table has no `pg_stats` rows at all**, which is why the join
 *    is a LEFT JOIN from `pg_class`. The table then appears once with every
 *    statistics column NULL — present and unknown, rather than absent. An inner join
 *    would omit it, and silence reads as zero.
 *  - **`pg_stats` is permission-filtered.** It is a view over `pg_statistic` that
 *    returns rows only for tables the calling role may read, so a least-privilege
 *    agent role sees "no statistics" for a table it cannot select from — the same
 *    shape as never analysed, and not distinguishable from here.
 *
 * `relkind` is restricted to ordinary (`r`) and partitioned (`p`) tables: those are
 * the relkinds `pg_stats` describes and that a plan's row estimates come from. A
 * view has no statistics of its own, and including one would add a row whose every
 * statistic is NULL for a reason unrelated to `ANALYZE`.

 * Anything else is the empty inventory rather than an exception: a row this cannot
 * read says nothing about its columns, and refusing it here would turn one malformed
 * row into a lost snapshot.
 *
 * The ELEMENTS are filtered for the same reason the value is, and the filter is the
 * load-bearing half: `Array.isArray` says nothing about what is IN the array, so a
 * `null` element used to reach the fold and be read as `column.name` — a TypeError,
 * raised where `buildPostgresTables` runs OUTSIDE `readInventory`'s catch, which ends
 * the run `internal` rather than degrading the capture (the shape B48 exists to keep
 * out of this path). A bad element is dropped rather than emptying the list: the rest
 * of the array is still an inventory, and losing one entry says less than losing the
 * table.
