/**
 * The column inventory, ONE ROW PER OBJECT, symmetric with the PostgreSQL arm (B52).
 *
 * The per-object column list is built by a correlated `FOR JSON PATH` subquery rather
 * than by `STRING_AGG`, because `FOR JSON` is the engine's own serialiser and quotes
 * a column name containing a quote, a bracket or a newline correctly without this
 * layer having to know how. Measured on AdventureWorks2022: 92 rows, and
 * `Person.Person`'s list arrives as one `nvarchar(max)` value rather than split across
 * rows: the 2033-character chunking `FOR JSON` does applies to a TOP-LEVEL `FOR JSON`
 * query, not to one used as a scalar subquery.
 *
 * `o.type` is `char(2)` and arrives padded (`'U '`), so it is trimmed: the value rides
 * along as this engine's own word for what the entry IS, the way `pg_class.relkind`
 * does on PostgreSQL, and a trailing space would make `'U '` and `'U'` two kinds.
 *
 * `system_type_id` and NOT `user_type_id`, which is the obvious spelling and the wrong
 * one. SQL Server ALIAS types are ordinary in a real schema and everywhere in this
 * fixture: measured, `Person.PersonPhone.PhoneNumber` answers `Phone` for the alias and
 * `nvarchar` for the base, and `Person.Person.FirstName` answers `Name` over `nvarchar`.
 * Nothing downstream knows an alias: `table-profile.ts` decides which columns get a text
 * SHAPE test and which are excluded from `count(DISTINCT …)` by matching this string
 * against base-type spellings, so with the alias name `profile_table` emitted no shape
 * test at all for `PhoneNumber` - the one column in that table the PII shapes exist to
 * find - and an alias over `text` would have failed the whole table's profile. The base
 * spelling is also the more useful of the two to a model writing SQL, which is what this
 * inventory is for; the object browser reads its own catalog and still shows the alias.
 *
 * COALESCE'd, because `system_type_id` alone is NULL for the system CLR types. They all
 * share id 240 and `TYPE_NAME(240)` answers NULL: measured, `Person.Address.SpatialLocation`
 * answers NULL for the base and `geography` for the alias, and `Production.Document.DocumentNode`
 * the same with `hierarchyid`. `FOR JSON PATH` omits a NULL property, so those columns would
 * have reached the snapshot with NO type at all, and a column with no type matches none of
 * `table-profile.ts`'s exclusions: `count(DISTINCT [SpatialLocation])` would then be composed
 * and the whole table's profile would fail with Msg 8117, "Operand data type geography is
 * invalid for count operator". So the base spelling where there is one, and the type's own
 * name where the base is NULL.
 *
 * `sys.objects` rather than `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`, for the reason the provider
 * gives for its own reads: `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` is permission-filtered in a way that
 * silently drops rows, and `is_ms_shipped` has no counterpart there at all.
