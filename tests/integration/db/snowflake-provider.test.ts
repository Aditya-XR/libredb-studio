/**
 * Snowflake provider, end to end over the fixtures.
 *
 * The real provider, account reader, key intake and JWT signer, transport lanes, statements, row reader, decoder,
 * object surface, panels and error table all run; only Snowflake is fake. The fake is the scripted node transport of
 * `tests/helpers/snowflake-node-transport.ts`, handed to the provider through its `deps` in place of the shared
 * `createNodeTransport` and `createNodeByteTransport`, so every request goes through the transport's seam and is
 * answered from a fixture. Time is injected (`testDeps`): the clock moves only when a test moves it, and no deadline
 * fires unless a test fires it. `mock.module()` is not used, no real timer runs and no socket opens.
 *
 * The payloads are a capture: `tests/fixtures/snowflake/trial-2026-10-12-v10.37.100/` is what a Snowflake trial
 * account answered on 2026-10-12, `CURRENT_VERSION()` 10.37.100, Enterprise edition, AWS EU_CENTRAL_2, recorded by
 * `tests/live/snowflake-evidence.ts` and scrubbed. Snowflake releases weekly, so that version is the capture's, not a
 * pin. Each case replays the captured scenario of its subject and asserts the captured answers; a scenario the
 * provider stops at a refusal holds a `stopped` record naming the statement it stopped at, and nothing after it.
 *
 * Each scenario's requests are checked against the fixture's, in order: the method, the path and its query (a
 * submit's `requestId` is the run's own), and the whole body. What is BUILT, each answer in the shape the capture
 * shows, and why:
 * - the role check's columns past `R` and `S` (the user since SF-005, the database, schema and warehouse since SF-019): the capture sent the two-column check, so
 *   `load()` widens every captured role check to `SNOWFLAKE_ROLE_CHECK_SQL`, its added cells answered as the account
 *   answers that connection (`widenRoleCheck`);
 * - every submit body without `parameters.timezone`: the capture sent `timezone: "UTC"`, which Studio stopped sending
 *   so statements run in the user's own TIMEZONE (SF-009), so `load()` takes it out (`withoutTimezone`);
 * - the role check answering another role: the account refuses a role the credentials may not use at connect with
 *   390186 (`refusal-390186`, `role-restricted-pat-show`), so no captured role check answers another role;
 * - a role holding no warehouse (391920): the account answers it only with secondary roles off, which this capture
 *   does not set; the code, status and message are the orchestrator's manual probe of 2026-10-13, which does not
 *   record which request answered, so the refusal is on the status GET as the captured 422 refusals are;
 * - active secondary roles on the key-pair user (`role-check-secondary` is not captured): the cell takes the shape
 *   M38 records;
 * - a suspended warehouse under the panels: `monitoring-suspended` and its twin without MONITOR ran on a warehouse
 *   the scenario before them had started, so their state read answers STARTED; the SUSPENDED row is M25's, captured
 *   on the same warehouse in step 1;
 * - a 403 gateway page (`refusal-403` needs a request from an address the network policy refuses) and a status GET of
 *   a gone handle (`refusal-404` needs a result older than Snowflake keeps);
 * - the other dashboard panels, the inventory and a view's source, answered in the test itself
 *   (`tests/helpers/snowflake-answers.ts`);
 * - the partition past the result budget, a small gzipped body that inflates past 16 MiB (a 16 MiB body cannot be a
 *   fixture; the 1 GiB decompression bomb is `tests/unit/db/snowflake/wire-heap.test.ts`'s), a status link to another
 *   host, the answers that echo a sentinel PAT, passphrase or JWT, the 10,000-character server message, a transport
 *   failure, and the extra status GET that hangs so a run is in flight when a test cancels it or disconnects.
 *
 * The private-host case of the address policy (a PrivateLink name resolving to 10.0.0.5 under
 * DB_HTTP_BLOCK_PRIVATE_HOSTS) needs the real transport and a stubbed resolver, so it is in
 * `tests/unit/db/snowflake/security-control.test.ts`, not here.
 *
 * Every provider a test builds is disconnected after it, so no permit of the process-wide engine limiter is left held
 * for the next test.
