/**
 * `mongo-inventory-check.ts`: a MongoDB command read against the run's captured inventory before anything is sent.
 *
 * The two mistakes it catches are the ones MongoDB answers with an empty result instead of an error, measured live on
 * 2026-10-17: a collection named with the inventory's `shop.` prefix (3 of 10 plan drafts), and a date or ObjectId
 * filtered as a plain string (runs reported "0 orders" and "the event does not exist").
